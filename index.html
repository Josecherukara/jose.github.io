                    <p>
                        I am a dedicated researcher and teacher at The Cochin College, Cochin. I completed my Ph.D. at IISER Thiruvananthapuram, where I specialized in General Relativity. My doctoral thesis is titled "Particle Physics models of Inflation in modified gravity". Prior to that, I earned my MSc from IIT Bombay, solidifying my foundation in physics.

                    <p>   
                        My research interests lie in the fascinating realms of early universe cosmology, with a particular focus on bounce, bounce inflation, and inflation. I am deeply intrigued by the implications of modified gravity on these phenomena. Additionally, I have a keen interest in perturbation theory and its applications in understanding the complexities of the cosmos.

                    <p>    
                        Through my work, I aim to contribute to our understanding of the universe's origins and the fundamental forces that shape its evolution. I am passionate about both advancing research in these areas and inspiring the next generation of physicists through teaching.

                    <p>    
                        I have a strong interest in programming, particularly in C, C++, Java, and Python. These languages allow me to solve problems efficiently and develop robust applications. Additionally, I am fascinated by AI, neural networks, and machine learning, which offer incredible potential for analyzing data and making intelligent predictions. My goal is to leverage these technologies to drive innovation and solve real-world challenges.
